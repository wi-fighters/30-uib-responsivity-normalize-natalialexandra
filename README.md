### Answers

1. **What do you notice now that `normalize.css` is being used?**

- The browser pre-settings are overwritten, for e.g. margin was removed.


2.  **Why is `normalize.css` useful?**

- Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them.
- Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements.
- Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
- Improve usability with subtle improvements.
- Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.


3. **What is the difference between normalize and css resets?**

- **Reset**

    The reset removes all default browser styling (everything).  
    For e.g. margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be the same.    
    You have to redeclare styling for every single  element.


- **Normalize**

    Normalize.css makes the default styles (built-in browser styling) look the same.

    It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.
